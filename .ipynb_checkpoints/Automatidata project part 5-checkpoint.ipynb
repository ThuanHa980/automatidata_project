    "You are a data professional in a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips."

    "**Purpose:** Want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers of customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predict if a customer will **not** leave a tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some ethical implications and consequences:\n",
    "- Likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a customer will give a tip, but they actually won't): Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app.\n",
    "- Likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a customer will not give a tip, but they actually will): Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It's not good to disincentivize drivers from picking up customers. It could also cause a customer backlash. The problems seem to outweigh the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, having all the considerations above, we can modify our model that predicts the most generous customers. This could accomplish the goal of helping taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips while preventing the wrongful exclusion of certain people from using taxis."

    "**Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ideally, we'd have behavioral history for each customer, so we could know how much they tipped on previous taxi rides. We'd also want times, dates, and locations of both pickups and dropoffs, estimated fares, and payment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The target variable would be a binary variable (1 or 0) that indicates whether or not the customer is expected to tip ≥ 20%.\n",

    "1. This model is recommend since it performs acceptably. Its F<sub>1</sub> score was 0.7235 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.6865. It correctly identified ~78% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 48% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.  \n",

    "2. Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.  \n",

    "3. We can improve this model by creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n",

    "4. Another way that we can improve the model would be in the data itsefl. If there are data that represent customer past tipping behavior and accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash, it could prove to be helpful. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination.\n",
