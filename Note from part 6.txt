Note for rounding the result to decimal

To understand why, you must consider how floats work. Computers make their calculations using floating-point arithmetic (hence the word "float"). Floating-point arithmetic is a system that allows computers to express both very large numbers and very small numbers with a high degree of precision, encoded in binary. However, precision is limited by the number of bits used to represent a number, which is generally 32 or 64, depending on the capabilities of your operating system. 

This comes with limitations in that sometimes calculations that should result in clean, precise values end up being encoded as very long decimals. Take, for example, the following calculation:
